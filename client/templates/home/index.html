                Sorry to disappoint you but this isn't THAT <br/>
                type of bar despite what the picture suggests. <br/>
                This BAR is the bar I have set for myself when I <br/>
                decided to become a web developer and I promise <br/>
                it will soon be clear as to why theme of choice was <br/>
                yummy alcoholic beverages (namely, Jin & Juice).

                This website serves as my re/presentation of my <br/>
                (sometimes difficult) journey through the world of <br/>
                web development and I hope to be continually <br/>
                raising the bar and improving upon the site.
